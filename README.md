# Blood Pressure Tracker

This web page, developed by Ashikur Rahman Provat, serves as a Blood Pressure History Tracker. Users can record and view their blood pressure readings over time. The interface includes a table displaying detailed information such as date, time, systolic, and diastolic values. Additionally, a dynamic chart is generated using Chart.js, presenting trends and variations in blood pressure levels throughout the recorded period. The user-friendly design allows for efficient monitoring of morning and afternoon readings, along with average systolic and diastolic values. Developed with Bootstrap for responsive design, this tool provides a comprehensive overview of blood pressure data, aiding users in maintaining a healthy lifestyle.
